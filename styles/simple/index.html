		<!-- KEEP THIS PARAGRAPH CONTENT THE SAME, BUT CHANGE THE LAYOUT AND STYLE TO MATCH YOUR SUBMISSION -->
		<p>
			<strong><em>Brutalism, Minimalism, Vaporwave, Retro, Futuristic...</em></strong> There’s so many design styles out there it can be tough to stay on top of them all!
			<br><br>
			Here at <strong>How About This Design?</strong> we help you choose your next great design by showing you real-world examples of various different design styles. Choose a style from the menu below, and watch this site morph right before your eyes!
			<br><br>
			The content of the site stays <em>mostly</em> the same, it just shifts around, changes palettes, and gets a bit aesthetically funky.<br>
			At the bottom of this page are examples from various categories (<em>product design, banners, merch, etc.</em>) that showcase a more specific breakdown of your chosen style.
			<br><br>
			<strong><em>We hope you find this useful!</em></strong>

			Oversimplifying complex and making things unrealistically simple<strong>How About This Design?</strong>
			Unless, of course, you wanna read about this site!<br>
			Yeah? Really? Ok, cool! (<em>if not, tough shit, I gotta fill this space with something</em>)
			<br><br>
			Do I build a portfolio site for myself? Nah, I already got my own website I can use for that...<br>
			Do I make a design community? Cool, but I feel like plenty already exist and I don’t have any creative ideas to improve upon them...<br>
			Do I... Hmm... How about... No... GAH! WHY ARE ALL THE GOOD NAMES ALREADY TAKEN!
			<br><br>
			And then... <strong>BAM!</strong> It hit me, how about I make a goose-themed news aggregator! <a href="https://goose.press">And so I did</a>.
			<br><br>
			BUT-- Back on track, I still had this whole ‘.design’ thing I needed to address. So, after heavy use of a thesaurus and many minutes of trying out different word combination, I finally landed on a neat idea: A site dedicated to the endless list of different design styles.
			<br><br>
			And that’s pretty much it. I ended up landing on <strong>HowAboutThis.Design</strong> as a niffty name, and I got to work building out the design gallery. Thankfully, I announced this idea during Hacktoberfest, so there's plenty of willing contributors to fiddle with various styles!
